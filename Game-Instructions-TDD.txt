wait until the first warrior moves again. Second warrior piece can then be placed on the square.

   -If he loses, that maximum returns to whatever it was before he took the treasure (6 or 8 moves).
   -Warrior with treasure HAS USED his maximum of 4 moves.
      If he wins, he must stop. His turn is over. If he loses, he may continue moving,
      since his maximum returns to whatever it was before he took the treasure (6 or 8 moves).
- Attacking Warrior (no treasure) has moved LESS THAN 4 squares.
   -Whether he wins or loses, he may continue moving, up to his maximum number of moves. 
      If he wins, that maximum drops to 4 moves. If he loses,
      that maximum remains whatever it was before combat (6 or 8).
   -Other warrior has moved AT LEAST 4 SQUARES but LESS than his maximum.
   -If he wins, he must stop. The treasure reduces his maximum to 4 moves. 
      If he loses, he may continue moving, up to his maximum (6 or 8 moves).
